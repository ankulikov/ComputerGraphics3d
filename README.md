# ComputerGraphics3d

This program was written as a HW for Computer Graphics in the Higher School of Economics

## Possibilities:

* Modeling 3D figures: Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Icosahedron, Sphere, "Drop", Torus, "Spring"
* Moving, rotating, scaling along all 3 axes (X,Y,Z) using a mouse
* Animation of rotating along custom axis (by setting a point and a direction vector)
* Three ortographic projections (front, top, side views) and one central projection
